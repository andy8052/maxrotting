## How It Works

The extension uses a content script that:

1. Builds a dictionary of word replacements
2. Walks through all text nodes in the DOM
3. Uses regex to find and replace whole words (preserving capitalization)
4. Observes DOM mutations to handle dynamically loaded content
5. Skips script, style, textarea, and input elements to avoid breaking functionality

## Word Count

The extension currently contains **500+** word and phrase replacements across categories:

- Common verbs (present and past tense)
- Common nouns
- Adjectives and adverbs
- Pronouns and phrases
- Maxxing terminology

- Agartha/Never StreSS lore
- Gooning terms
